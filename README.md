# SquAdventury: Privacy Policy

This is the official privacy policy for SquAdventury, which is currently available on the google play store.

This game saves the content of the "Bug Report" segment form via an external server at the user's request. The content is saved in a database in order to help the game developer in fixing bugs discovered by users. In addition to the bug reported by the user, his public ip is also saved, in order to avoid spam activities. The user's IP is deleted once every half hour and the reported bug is deleted when it is resolved. 

This data collection is done only when using the "Bug Report" segment of the respective game.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
